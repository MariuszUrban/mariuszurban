### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After several years of work in artistic industries I decided to enrich my competences and learn to code. Iâ€™ve chosen web development as skill that would connect my interests and future goals all together. As enthusiast of many aspects of visual culture, I wanted to learn how to present cultural and entertaining content online, or for example, how I can create tools for knowledge and information exchange - making them also visually appealing and adjusted to individual demands. So, beside learning front-end skills, Iâ€™m very interested in getting familiar with aspects of UX design in the nearest future.

### At the moment I'm working on: 

### - Movie for Mood
movie searcher which purpose is to find movie suggestions that are based on user's emotions or feelings. It gives a new way of finding a suitable movie     proposition, matching to user's moods or atmoshpere they are in at the moment. Also, the goal of the app is to propose unique findings of movies you have never heard before and are definiately worth to watch, spreading at the same time knowlege of cinema history.
