### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After several years of work in artistic industries I decided to enrich my competences and learn to code. Iâ€™ve chosen web development as skill that would connect my interests and future goals all together. As enthusiast of many aspects of visual culture, I wanted to learn how to present cultural and entertaining content online, or for example, how I can create tools for knowledge and information exchange - making them also visually appealing and adjusted to individual demands.
